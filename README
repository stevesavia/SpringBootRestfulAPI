A small POC Spring project written for a code test, with Restful GET and POST API calls, persisting data using 
PostgreSQL. It connects to a database called 'pg_demo2' and writes/reads to/from a table called 'notes', and 
username and password have to be set in the properties file.

It does not have a front-end, but can be tested with an API tester (e.g. Postman).  Were a front-end to be added, 
this could readily be done in Spring Boot using the templating language Thymeleaf.
